    <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
    <p>
      When people understand that their brain function is malleable, it can have an effect on their response when they aren’t quite able to achieve something. Instead of giving up they’re more likely to accept it as a challenge. It’s not uncommon for people to become stuck in the mindset that we are incapable of learning specific skills. Once we learn that through practicing activities that increase neuroplasticity we can change our attitudes around learning drastically.
    </p>
    <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit. What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <div class="textbox">
<b>Some things that I enjoy already that I found are great for increasing neuroplasticity:</b><ul><li>Learning new crafts</li><li>Learning to play new music/instruments</li><li>Learning new languages (spoken, coding)</li><li>Reading fiction books</li><li>Playing video games (especially learning to play new ones)</li><li>Going to gigs and art exhibitions</li><li>Practicing Mindfulness</li></ul>
<b>Some things that are important to keep in mind to get the most out of these sorts of activities:</b><ul><li>They must be something you are interested in/enjoy</li><li>Pay specific attention to the task at hand. Focus on exact tasks.</li><li>Practice. Do these things often.</li></ul>
</div>
    <p>
I think I could definitely be more persistent with some of these activities. I can at times get bored and move on to the next thing quickly. The university of Utah resource says “Plan for lapses – it’s normal. Refocus, adjust your schedule, and keep going”
<br><br>
It’s great that most ways to increase neuroplasticity are stimulating, fun and at times challenging! 
<br><br>
Another great thing about neuroplasticity is that it can be used in therapeutic ways. It can assist in the wellbeing of people with chronic illnesses, trauma, injuries and other impairments. In a couple of months I’ll be taking part in a neurofeedback study for my own chronic illness where participants' brain waves will be monitored and a sound will play when the brain starts behaving in a desired way. This sort of therapy which helps patients develop new pathways is being used increasingly and is regularly found to be effective for new things. It’s even been found effective for things like glaucoma!

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <h3>What is it and why is it relevant?</h3>
    <p>
      This describes the mindset we can take on once we know intelligence can be developed. It fosters resilience, inspiration from others and an openness to new challenges and criticism. This is the kind of mindset that will enable us to get the most out of our learning experience in this course.
    </p>
    <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    <p>
      I think learning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset has certainly given me a more positive attitude towards learning. I think it’s a pretty simple concept to understand so it’s something I’ve told friends about. These conversations have been super positive and productive so I can see these conversations being valuable in the future for maintaining my own growth mindset.
    </p>
    <h3>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
    <p>
      I don’t think it will be particularly hard knowing what I know now. I already feel that I am embracing new challenges and trying to find new ways to get out of my comfort zone. Instead of just getting the work done I’m finding new ways to challenge myself whether that be learning about things more thoroughly or taking on stretch material. I enjoy the challenge of adding extra features to the inner workings of my blog each week even though it may not be obvious to anyone. I hope I can continue to maintain a growth mindset.

    <h2>How these can help shape my learning plan:</h2>
    <p>
      I think with regards to my learning plan, maintaining a growth mindset will help me achieve in the areas that I expressed. During this sprint I have been exploring the tools that I could use for a coding project of personal interest. I think this is going to be a good addition to my learning strategy. It can be a way to extend myself and practice things I have learned in the course. If I am working on this project I think I will comfortably be able to say I have the desire to learn that comes with that growth mindset.
