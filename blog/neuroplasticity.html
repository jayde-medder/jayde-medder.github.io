    <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
    <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
    <p>
      When people understand that their brain function is malleable, it can have an effect on their response when they aren’t quite able to achieve something. Instead of giving up they’re more likely to accept it as a challenge. It’s not uncommon for people to become stuck in the mindset that we are incapable of learning specific skills. Once we learn that through practicing activities that increase neuroplasticity we can change our attitudes around learning drastically.
    </p>
    <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit. What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <div class="textbox">
<b>Some things that I enjoy already that I found are great for increasing neuroplasticity:</b><ul><li>Learning new crafts</li><li>Learning to play new music/instruments</li><li>Learning new languages (spoken, coding)</li><li>Reading fiction books</li><li>Playing video games (especially learning to play new ones)</li><li>Going to gigs and art exhibitions</li><li>Practicing Mindfulness</li></ul>
<b>Some things that are important to keep in mind to get the most out of these sorts of activities:</b><ul><li>They must be something you are interested in/enjoy</li><li>Pay specific attention to the task at hand. Focus on exact tasks.</li><li>Practice. Do these things often.</li></ul>
</div>
    <p>
I think I could definitely be more persistent with some of these activities. I can at times get bored and move on to the next thing quickly. The university of Utah resource says “Plan for lapses – it’s normal. Refocus, adjust your schedule, and keep going”
<br><br>
It’s great that most ways to increase neuroplasticity are stimulating, fun and at times challenging! 
<br><br>
Another great thing about neuroplasticity is that it can be used in therapeutic ways. It can assist in the wellbeing of people with chronic illnesses, trauma, injuries and other impairments. In a couple of months I’ll be taking part in a neurofeedback study for my own chronic illness where participants' brain waves will be monitored and a sound will play when the brain starts behaving in a desired way. This sort of therapy which helps patients develop new pathways is being used increasingly and is regularly found to be effective for new things. It’s even been found effective for things like glaucoma!
