  <h1>JavaScript DOM</h1>
  <body>
    <h2>JavaScript for Dummies!</h2>
    <p>In this sprint we began learning JavaScript. This language enables our websites to become interactive! In the first few weeks of foundations we learnt that HTML defines what goes on a web page, and css makes it look pretty. With Javascript we’re able to define processes that add functionality. A good analogy could be a film crew where HTML is the writer, CSS is the wardrobe/set designer and JavaScript is the director.</p>

    <h3>Control Flow & Loops</h3>
    <p>Control flow is the order in which a computer carries out defined processes. By using loops, we can check through a set of information. By utilizing these features we can modify and assess varying input data.</p>
    <p>Here’s a day to day example of how control flow and looping works. For simplicity, the inner workings of the washDish function are not yet defined.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>let dishes = [‘pot’, ‘pan’, ‘plate’, ‘big plate’, ‘ramekin’, tiny bowl’]	//this is an array of dishes

        washDish(dish){	//here’s our process for washing a dish!
          scrub(dish)
          rinse(dish)	//we haven’t yet added functions for scrub() and rinse()
          addtoDryingRack(dish)	//maybe this one could take said dish out of the dishes array and add to a new array full of items in the drying rack!
        }
        
        doTheDishes(setOfDishes){		//our process for doing a set of dishes!
          For each(dish in setOfDishes){	//this loop says for each dish we will do the washDish function!
            washDish(dish)
          }
        }

        doTheDishes(dishes) //here we are calling the function. This says, “you now know how to do the dishes so go and get started!”
        </code>
