    <h2>EQ vs. IQ</h2>
    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>Emotional intelligence is a set of skills that we can train with regards to understanding ourselves and our emotions and engaging with our surroundings with less reactivity.</p>
    <p>One way to cultivate emotional intelligence is to practice three steps; Practicing mindfulness, self-mastery (increasing self knowledge) and creating useful mental habits. These steps flow on quite seamlessly, as practicing mindfulness will in turn help us learn about ourselves. Staying mindful of our external and internal experience enables us to focus attention on what is happening around us and how it makes us feel before reacting. Some mindfulness practices include mindfulness as a secular form of meditation, conscious listening and journaling. Once we have gained a knowledge of ourselves and our internal experience we can start to develop mental habits that help us to behave in a way that isnâ€™t reactive/impulsive and is well thought through. There are so many ways to create mental habits and they can vary between people. These can pertain to situations involving peers or can be used to shape attitudes around individual pursuits.</p>
    <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is a way of evaluating basic intelligence. There is some debate around whether a person's IQ can increase through some intervention.</p>
    <p>EQ (Emotional Quotient) is a way of measuring emotional intelligence. Because of neuroplasticity, we are able to increase our EQ. Increasing neuroplasticity means to increase the ability of neural networks in the brain to change and adapt to lived experiences.</p>
    <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
    <p>Both EQ and IQ have an influence on how we perform with our work. Because we are able to increase neuroplasticity no matter what age we are, it is important to practice skills that will increase neuroplasticity and EQ in order to perform to a higher level - especially in the tech sector where learning is an ongoing process. Research shows that top performers in the tech industry generally perform better with regards to EQ than their peers. Emotional intelligence also has an influence on happiness and fulfillment. When our minds are healthy we can feel more capable, stable and grounded.</p>
    <p>To put things really simply, I think increasing emotional intelligence can give you a really healthy attitude towards everything around you. We all know what it feels like when a good attitude pays off!</p>
