    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
  <body>
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>One day I would like to be involved in building sound manipulation software or doing sound design for video games. I also enjoy front end development and am currently enjoying web design so these could be potential career pathways for me as well.</p>
    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <p>I’m not very good at retaining information that I have read or that has been demonstrated to me. I need to do things myself to learn. I’m pretty good at retaining skills and adapting them to fit new purposes once learned. I can get really stuck into things to the point that I forget to give myself breaks. Time management is important!</p>
    <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>Teamwork and in particular communicating regularly. I work well independently but need to remember to check in with my team/facilitators often.</p>
    <h3>How will you will manage your workload in this programme? </h3>
    <p>I need to make sure I am managing life outside of course work effectively so I have sufficient time to complete tasks and be available for communications with others involved in the learning process. I also need to remember to take regular breaks. When things are building up I will make sure to be transparent with facilitators and team members. When I need to seek help I can do so in discord and either post about the issue or chat with people in the help desk or common spaces. I’ll make sure to do this if I notice myself getting stuck for 20 minutes or more.</p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>To be mostly available in the daytime on weekdays. To be able to help with technical and interpersonal issues. To be on board with my learning plan!</p>
    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
    <p>I should be available 9-5 on weekdays. I will commit at least 4 hours each weekday to study. Sometimes I will have casual work commitments.</p>
