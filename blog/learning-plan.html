    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>Sprint 5 update!</h2>
    <div class = "textbox"><h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3><p>I’d like to be involved in projects that have a direct impact within my local community. Long term I would like to be involved with sound design for software or video games but I also enjoy front-end development. With CODE funding available in Dunedin it means there might be more opportunities within the industry here so video game development would be a good start for me. It would also be rewarding to do freelance web development for community based projects.</p></div>
    <div class = "textbox"><h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3><p><i>Sprint 2 answer: “I’m not very good at retaining information that I have read or that has been demonstrated to me. I need to do things myself to learn. I’m pretty good at retaining skills and adapting them to fit new purposes once learned. I can get really stuck into things to the point that I forget to give myself breaks. Time management is important!”</i></p><h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3><p>I have learned a few strategies to deal with my limitations. I started using a chrome extension for dictation when online reading becomes difficult. I realised also that exploring different approaches to a problem, and when/why they’re used is important in understanding features of my code. For example I might use some array method, but also look into other ones and figure out which is most suitable and why. This is something I often do in the refactoring stage of a problem or as I am implementing it. I’m also better at taking breaks, and set myself times for them.</p><p>Another limitation I have noticed is my tendency to resist asking for help. I think once I can get over this I will feel a lot more comfortable with where I’m at. I think it’s important to keep in touch with facilitators and team members to get more of a sense of how I am doing. I’ve found that when I speak to peers about their work I am intrigued by the differences in their approaches and realise that being inspired in this way is important for my growth.</p></div>
    <div class = "textbox"><h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3><p><i>Sprint 2 Answer: “Teamwork and in particular communicating regularly. I work well independently but need to remember to check in with my team/facilitators often.”</i></p><p>I seem to be getting a little bit better at communicating with team members but could talk more with facilitators. I enjoy talking with team members so I hope to do this more regularly and do a bit more peer programming.</p><h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3><p>Giving and recieving feedback is something I haven’t experienced much of in this course thus far. I think this might be a challenging aspect of bootcamp, specifically giving feedback. I would imagine it’s probably something I will need to work on. It would be cool to develop leadership skills as well. Self reflection is something I would like to stay on top of during bootcamp as it has been an integral part of foundations.</p></div>
    <div class = "textbox"><h3>How will you will manage your workload in this programme? </h3><p><i>Sprint 2 Answer: "I need to make sure I am managing life outside of course work effectively so I have sufficient time to complete tasks and be available for communications with others involved in the learning process. I also need to remember to take regular breaks. When things are building up I will make sure to be transparent with facilitators and team members. When I need to seek help I can do so in discord and either post about the issue or chat with people in the help desk or common spaces. I’ll make sure to do this if I notice myself getting stuck for 20 minutes or more."</i></p><p>Foundations has given me a good sense for how I might manage time effectively during bootcamp. I enjoy doing a little bit of coding most days and will be aiming to do some every day. </p></div>
    <div class = "textbox"><h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3><p>To be mostly available in the daytime on weekdays. To be able to help with technical and interpersonal issues. To be on board with my learning plan!</p></div>
    <div class = "textbox"><h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3><p><i>Sprint 2 Answer: I should be available 9-5 on weekdays. I will commit at least 4 hours each weekday to study. Sometimes I will have casual work commitments.</i></p></div>
    <div class = "textbox"><h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3><p>Sticking to play plan of doing a bit of coding every day. I will make sure to be managing my health and referring back to the Te Whare Tapa Whā task to remind me how to do so effectively. I will commit myself to mindful listening techniques when talking to facilitators and peers. I have noticed that in doing so I develop a real sense of appreciation for my peers.</p></div>
