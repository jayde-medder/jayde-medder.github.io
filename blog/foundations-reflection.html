    <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Before the course, I used to compare myself to others instead of appreciating their strengths. However, I've learned that being inspired by others is essential for a growth-oriented mindset.</li>
      <li>I've realized that my ego craves control, making me resistant to asking for help. I understand that this is something I still need to work on.</li>
      <li>Stepping out of my comfort zone can be challenging for me, as I tend to prefer sticking with what I know. While this approach is acceptable during the learning phase, I recognise the importance of regularly exploring new ideas and ways of doing things in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p>Our values act as a moral compass, guiding our decision-making process and ensuring our actions align with our principles. They enable us to make ethical choices in our work. Empathy plays a crucial role in fostering effective collaboration within teams and creating a supportive and inclusive work environment. It allows us to understand and consider the perspectives and needs of others. Additionally, self-awareness helps us recognise our strengths, weaknesses, and biases. By being self-aware, we can undergo personal growth and enhance our problem-solving skills.</p>
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>One of the challenging aspects of the core learning was examining and confronting my ego. Self reflection is particularly hard at this point in time due to health reasons. With that taken into account I think it has been an important time to acknowledge my limitations and areas for improvement.</p>
    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p>We are dedicating significant time to core learning because we understand that technical skills alone are not sufficient for success in the field. The skills we have learned are essential for personal and professional growth. They allow us to become well-rounded developers who understand the implications of our work and collaborate well in teams.</p>
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    <p>It doesn't feel like a waste at all. Personally, I've found the content enjoyable and have even discussed it with friends, recognising its universal benefits. The material covered in this program is valuable for anyone and has fostered a positive attitude towards learning. It will certainly contribute to us becoming well-rounded developers, equipped with interpersonal skills that will greatly benefit our teams. Overall, the core learning experience has been highly valuable and rewarding.</p>
