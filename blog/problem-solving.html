    <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>
    <h3>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
    <div class ="textbox">
<b>What was the problem?</b>
In the JavaScript Kata for this sprint we had to write a function which takes a number and returns ‘Fizz’ if the number can be divided by 3, ‘Buzz’ if divisible by 5 and ‘FizzBuzz’ if divisible by 15.
<br>
<b>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</b>
Reading error messages, trying something new, using console.log to see my output. In the end I found that reformatting my code worked eventually but I still wasn’t sure why previous methods didn’t work.
<br>
<b>How did you feel throughout the process?</b>
Kind of annoyed! I was confused as to why some of my outputs were incorrect.
<br>
<b>What did you learn?</b>
I think this would’ve been a good one to ask for help on. I could’ve checked if chat gpt could tell me exactly where I had gone wrong or ask a peer/tutor for help. Perhaps also more extensive use of console.log might have helped to understand my errors.
