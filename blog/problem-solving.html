    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>
    <h3>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
    <div class ="textbox">
<b>What was the problem?</b>
In the JavaScript Kata for this sprint we had to write a function which takes a number and returns ‘Fizz’ if the number can be divided by 3, ‘Buzz’ if divisible by 5 and ‘FizzBuzz’ if divisible by 15.
<br>
<b>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</b>
Reading error messages, trying something new, using console.log to see my output. In the end I found that reformatting my code worked eventually but I still wasn’t sure why previous methods didn’t work.
<br>
<b>How did you feel throughout the process?</b>
Kind of annoyed! I was confused as to why some of my outputs were incorrect.
<br>
<b>What did you learn?</b>
I think this would’ve been a good one to ask for help on. I could’ve checked if chat gpt could tell me exactly where I had gone wrong or ask a peer/tutor for help. Perhaps also more extensive use of console.log might have helped to understand my errors.
    </div>
    <h3>2. Elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
    <div class = "textbox">
<b>What was the problem?</b>
In the JavaScript Kata module this week we had to write a function to find where Scooby was hiding within an array of objects. 
<br>
<b>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</b>
First I googled how to use the find() method and looked at the documentation. I wrote a similar method to examples I found using find() and used console.log to find the desired output and to see what my function was doing. I read the error messages. At this point I thought I might have to turn my objects into arrays and have the function iterate through multiple arrays with a loop. Then I googled again how to use find() with arrays of objects. This gave me a really simple way of completing the task.
<br>
<b>How did you feel throughout the process?</b>
I was confused about how to use array methods with an array of objects. I thought it was going to be more complex than it turned out to be so I was worried I might be stuck for a while.
<br>
<b>What did you learn?</b>
I learned how to use find() on arrays of objects! I also learned that when using methods like this, there’s probably often quite a simple way to get desired results. Therefore it’s important to understand the different applications for built in methods before trying something.

    <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
    <div class = "textbox">
<b>Pseudocode</b> - Sometimes I will write pseudocode comments where my code will go or on paper. It can be a helpful step. I am finding it to be useful when writing code manually but I’m also finding there are lots of built in methods that can replace chunks of code.
<br>
<b>Trying something</b> - I think this is useful at first but is more effective when you understand what tools are available to you prior to jumping in.
<br>
<b>Rubber ducky method</b> - I haven’t used this much, I guess it’s a bit like pseudocode but more simplified. Explaining something in a simplified manner is a great way to find keywords that might be useful in google searches. I should use this more.
<br>
<b>Reading error messages</b> - This is important and I do it all the time. It’s generally good for semantic/syntax errors.
<br>
<b>Console.logging</b> - Great for aiding in the problem-solving process. I feel confident using console.log to see what output I’m getting at certain stages.
<br>
<b>Googling</b> - Confident using google frequently. I enjoy exploring all of the aspects of the methods I’m using to make sure I’m using everything in an efficient way. It’s useful for finding solutions to similar problems and documentation for features of coding languages.
<br>
<b>Asking your peers for help</b> - I’m not great at asking for help but I think I will get more used to it when we start working more in teams.
<br>
<b>Asking coaches for help</b> - I feel more comfortable with this and will get more used to it as challenges become more difficult.
<br>
<b>Improving your process with reflection</b> - I do this often. Sometimes I will have a look at similar code examples on the internet once completing a task and if they’re significantly more efficient than my outcome I might update my code.
    </div>
    <h3>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h3>
    <div class = "textbox">
In the FizzBuzz task I could have asked for help. I think I knew I could get there quickly with trial and error but it didn’t help me to properly understand the errors I was getting. I think I am often reluctant to ask because I know it will be something small. I should remember to ask in the future so I can better understand where I’ve gone wrong.
