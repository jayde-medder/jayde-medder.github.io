    <h1>Identity, Values & Strengths</h1>
  <body>
    <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <p>Since finishing my degree in 2018 I have been quite involved in the music community in Dunedin. The people I have met in this time have shaped my identity and values in a big way. I think something that entices people to pursue music/arts in Dunedin is the fact that everyone involved is community minded and the focus seems to be more on helping each other out rather than doing things out of self interest. I can see myself having the same attitude towards this course and also future work in development. I’d love to one day be building things that benefit my local community and the people around me.

    <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
    <p>I did a couple of the online personality/strengths tests recommended. The 4 bird test gave me ‘Dove’. Doves are people-oriented, loyal, team-players/mediators. In group work I tend to fall into whatever role suits me based on the personalities/skills of others. I can easily just go with the flow in a supporting role or take on more work if necessary.</p><p>I also did a strengths finder test which said my top 3 qualities are Forgiveness, Judgement and Honesty. I really value honesty and transparency and I think this makes me an effective communicator. I hope to communicate often with facilitators and team members throughout this course to make the most of these strengths.

    <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
    <p>The strengths finder also told me my lesser-strengths i.e. things I need to work on. These were self regulation, zest, perseverance. With regards to all of these, I think I could definitely work on self-discipline and meeting self set expectations. At the moment, I’m really enjoying the course and I’m finding it easy to set goals for myself and achieve them. Hopefully I can keep this up throughout, because I would love to go the extra mile with the parts of the course that I have particular interest in. I think as long as I can maintain a positive attitude towards what I’m working on I should be able to thrive. </p>
    <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
    <p>I once had a job for about a month where the wellbeing of all staff members was being neglected. Along with my resignation, I sent a letter to the manager outlining legislation that protected the rights of the staff. I was pretty nervous about doing so because I generally try to avoid conflict. A co-worker told me that the manager had then informed the staff of their rights and apologised. I’m glad to have made some positive change. It’s very important to me that the people around me are treated fairly.</p>
    <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
    <p>When I studied Computer Science at university, we didn’t get the full rundown of how to use github effectively so we’d often run into situations when working in teams where members would fork off and go in a completely different direction without communicating properly with the team. We would debate over which version of the project to run with, and I think the tension caused was a result of not understanding how to use these tools effectively. Having a better understanding of github now, I think we could have been discussing allocation of work. This seems like an obvious thing to do! I’m glad that we’re now learning the value of interpersonal skills.</p>
